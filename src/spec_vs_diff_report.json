  "summary": "Most PWA installability requirements are implemented: manifest + standalone display, HTML metadata (manifest link, theme-color, iOS web app tags, apple-touch-icon), in-app install prompt UX for Android/iOS, and a service worker with registration done outside the immutable main.tsx. One potential gap is that the required icon image files themselves are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated in the diff summary (only referenced). Additionally, some unrelated styling/theme changes appear to be included.",

      "reason": "The manifest and index.html reference the required icon paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual PNG icon files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (only code/text files are listed). If those images are not already present, the requirement would not be fully met.",
