  "summary": "All three requested frontend requirements (App Link area with copy+fallback, troubleshooting panel referencing the exact error text and steps, and derived slug note) appear to be implemented via new components and a slugify utility, then composed into App.tsx. One additional footer attribution/link (caffeine.ai referral) was added that is not part of the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to surface the derived slug in a small admin/developer note; it did not request adding third-party attribution/referral links or related footer content.",
